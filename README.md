### This project holds all the necessary artifacts for my ansible session.

* All the code related to the session is present under `demo-lab` folder.
* All the presentation/documentation content is present under `documentation` folder.
  * Outline of the session is present in [session-outline.md](documentation/session-outline.md)
  * If you just want the list of commands used in the session you can find it inside [command_list.md](documentation/command_list.md)


  #### Trivia
  - The presentation (session-outline.html) is reveal js based presentation. It was created from the markdown file using an atom package - [markdown-preview-enhanced](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced). It seems to do a decent job at this.
